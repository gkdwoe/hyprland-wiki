hyprlang is a library that implements parsing for the hypr configuration language.

## Syntax

### Line style

Every config line is a command followed by a value.

```ini
COMMAND = VALUE
```

The command can be a variable, or a special keyword (those are defined by the app
you are using)

Variables are like "options", while keywords are like "commands". Options can be specified
only once (if you do it more times, it will overwrite the previous one),
while commands invoke some behavior every time they are defined.

The trailing spaces at the beginning and end of words are not necessary, and are
there only for legibility.

### Categories

Categories can be regular, and "special".

Both are specified the same:

```ini
category {
    variable = value
}
```

Special categories can have other properties, like for example containing a key:

```ini
special {
    key = A
    variable = value
}
special {
    key = B
    variable = value
}
```

This is like defining two "groups", one with the key of A, another with B. Hyprland for
example uses those for per-device configs.

### Defining variables

Variables can be defined like so:

```ini
$VAR = myData
```

Later on, you can use them like so:

```ini
$SUFFIX = -san
$NAME = Jeremy
greeting = Hello, $NAME$SUFFIX.
```

You do not need spaces to separate values, or spaces around values.

### Comments

Comments are started with the `#` character.

If you want to escape it (put an actual `#` and not start a comment) you can use
`##`. It will be turned into a single `#` that _will_ be a part of your line.

### Escaping errors

If you use plugins, you may want to ignore errors from missing options/keywords
so that you don't get an error bar before they are loaded. To do so, do this:

```ini
# hyprlang noerror true

bind = MOD, KEY, something, amogus
someoption = blah

# hyprlang noerror false
```

### Inline options

If you want to specify an option inline, without opening and closing a category, the separator is `:`:

```ini
category:variable = value
```

If the category is special and requires a key, you can do:

```ini
category[keyvalue]:variable = value
```

This is the syntax used by `hyprctl keyword`, for example.
